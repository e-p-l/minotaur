<!-- PROJECT TITLE -->
<div align="center">
<h3 align="center">Minotaur</h3>

    An implementation of 2 differents kind of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Non-Playable Characters (NPCs).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an implementation of a Hierachical Task Network (HTN) and a Behaviour Tree (BT) that fight together to steal/defend a treasure in a small maze. The 4 adventurers behaviour are implemented through a BT that encourages cooperations between them through differents tasks. On the other side, the minotaur that safeguards the treasure is implemented using a HTN that observes the actions of the adventurers then reacts accordingly.

The simulation is designed in a way that the adventurers win most of the time, but still face a challenge.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Don't mind the very primitive character/maze design, I focus on the behaviour of the characters :)

Here's is one of the possible scenarios where 3 of the adventurers (1 melee and 1 ranged) attack the minotaur at the same time to distract him while the 4th adventurer steals the treasure and brings it back to it's corner.
